# AURA ONE

**A Unified AI Operating System for Hospitals.**

AURA ONE is a next-generation hospital management platform that combines a **Patient Digital Twin**, **Real-time Vitals Monitoring**, **Indoor Navigation**, and **AI Assistance** into a seamless ecosystem.

---

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The system consists of three connected applications:

1.  **`server/` (Backend)**

    - **Tech**: NestJS, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Socket.IO.
    - **Role**: Central API, AI Gateway, WebSocket Hub (Relays simulated data to dashboard).
    - **Features**: Authentication, Patient Management, Map Pathfinding, Data Relay.

2.  **`mobile/` (Patient Dashboard)**

    - **Tech**: Flutter (iOS/Android).
    - **Role**: The primary interface for patients and doctors.
    - **Features**:
      - **Dynamic Dashboard**: Real-time Vitals Cards (ECG, SpO2, BP).
      - **Indoor Navigation**: A\* Pathfinding on hospital maps.
      - **AI Assistant**: Voice/Text chat for medical queries.
      - **Digital Twin**: 3D-style health visualization.

3.  **`health_data/` (Hardware Simulator)**
    - **Tech**: Flutter (Android).
    - **Role**: Simulates a medical vitals monitor.
    - **Features**: Generates realistic ECG (PQRST), SpO2 waveforms, and vital sign numbers; streams to server via WebSockets.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- Flutter SDK (v3.16+)
- Docker & Docker Compose (for DB)

### 1. Database Infrastructure

Start the PostgreSQL database:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 2. Backend Server

The server coordinates everything.

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run start
```

- _Note_: The server IP (e.g., `172.20.10.3`) is needed for the apps to connect.

### 3. Health Data Simulator (The "Medical Monitor")

Run this on a separate device (Android recommended) to act as the source of truth.

```bash
cd health_data
flutter run
```

- **Usage**: Go to Settings -> Enter Server IP -> Connect -> Start Monitoring.

### 4. Patient Dashboard (The "Receiver")

Run this to visualize the data.

```bash
cd mobile
flutter run
```

- **Usage**: Log in -> View the "My Digital Twin" dashboard. The graphs will animate in sync with the simulator!

## ✨ Key Features

- **Real-time Vitals Sync**: Sub-second latency streaming of waveforms from Simulator -> Server -> Dashboard.
- **Premium UI**: Glassmorphism aesthetic, "Outfit" typography, and animated Vitals Cards.
- **Smart Navigation**: Percentage-based coordinate mapping for accurate indoor wayfinding.
